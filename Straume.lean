Every stream is laggy, samples are expected to fail, pushes are expected to be slow to present new data, if no new data has arrived yet.
Thus, every stream is equipped with a clock, as well as tracking how much data was streamed through it to the moment.
Reading from a stream implies a timeout.
It means that synchronous Stream (the only one currently implemented) is, really, a synchronous API for an async IO task.
Any read can fail with a timeout.

You can model a stream outside IO, say, for model checking and other testing approaches.
Code using Streams is be compatible with system testing if and only if the it is equpped with a facility to hoist the outer monad.

/- False positives are used to represent probabilistic results.

TODO: It's known that the runtime we're targetting at Yatima isn't well-suited for Floats. Our ProbParOrd wants Float probabilities.
Perhaps, it makes sense, for probabilistic computations, to equip those with a probability approximation facilities to convert those to some close rational number.

Partial probabilistic ordering for timestamped events.
The probabilistic bit is needed for the forward compatibility with Bloom Clocks.

NB!
The wording is important.
Partial probabilistic ordering means that it's certainly partial and perhaps ordered.
If something is incomparable, you can be sure that the preimages of it are incomparable, if something is less than something else, you are given a confidence in the ordering.

A way to terminate a stream.
`eos` means "end of stream", expected one.
`timeout` means that the Lean runner itself timed out (note that ioerr has `timeExpired` constructor, which is the same, but for OS timeouts)
`ioerr` means that we were running the stream as an IO task, and we got an IO error while performing it.

Suppose we have a variable length binary protocol such that the message length is encoded as a three bit integer.

 |-3-|----n----|-3-|---|
 | 7 | 1001111 | 1 | 0 |

Naturally, chunks are:

 1001111, .none

 001, .some eos

and are of type `Chunk (List Bit)`.

But if we insist, we consume it bit by bit by typing it as `Chunk Bit`:

 | 111 1001111 011 001 |

Chunks are

 1, .none
 1, .none
 1, .none
 1, .none
 0, .none
 ...
 1, .some eos

I hope it's clear. 🙇

Simplest *practical* stream! It has strictly one source, hecnce the name.

This structure is really stupid. It doesn't know it's a stream. All the stuff happens in the functions like `splitAt`.
Note that they are generic in the wrapper-monad and in a particular time implementation.
So you can test everything under simulation outside IO.
