Every stream is laggy, samples are expected to fail, pushes are expected to be slow to present new data, if no new data has arrived yet.
Thus, every stream is equipped with a clock, as well as tracking how much data was streamed through it to the moment.
Reading from a stream implies a timeout.
It means that synchronous Stream (the only one currently implemented) is, really, a synchronous API for an async IO task.
Any read can fail with a timeout.

You can model a stream outside IO, say, for model checking and other testing approaches.
Code using Streams is be compatible with system testing if and only if the it is equpped with a facility to hoist the outer monad.
For more details on this approach, consult this exchange in haskell-cafe:

/- False positives are used to represent probabilistic results.

TODO: It's known that the runtime we're targetting at Yatima isn't well-suited for Floats. Our ProbParOrd wants Float probabilities.

Partial probabilistic ordering for timestamped events.
The probabilistic bit is needed for the forward compatibility with Bloom Clocks.

NB!
The wording is important.
Partial probabilistic ordering means that it's certainly partial and perhaps ordered.
If something is incomparable, you can be sure that the preimages of it are incomparable, if something is less than something else, you are given a confidence in the ordering.
